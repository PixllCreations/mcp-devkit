## 🎯 The Problem

Claude is amazing for development, but suffers from critical limitations:

- **Context Drift** 🌊 - Loses focus during long development sessions
- **Memory Loss** 🧠 - Forgets project context between sessions  
- **No Persistence** 💾 - Architectural decisions disappear when conversations end
- **Project Abandonment** 🏗️ - No way to resume stalled projects systematically

## ✨ The Solution

mcp-devkit transforms Claude into your **persistent development partner** through an MCP server that provides:

### 🧠 **Persistent Project Memory**
- Project state survives across all Claude sessions
- Architectural decisions and progress automatically preserved
- Never lose context when returning to a project

### 🎯 **Development Guidance & Anti-Drift**
- Systematic task prioritization keeps Claude focused
- Drift detection prevents over-architecture and scope creep
- Clear breakpoints prevent context overload

### 🤝 **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
- Delegate planning and review to specialized AIs (GPT-4, Gemini)
- Get expert consultation without bloating Claude's context
- Maintain implementation focus while leveraging multiple perspectives

### 🚀 **Project Recovery**
- Analyze any existing codebase and generate recovery plans
- Identify exactly where development stalled and why
- Resume abandoned projects with specific next steps

## 🔧 How It Works

### For Claude Users:
```typescript
// Claude can directly call these tools during development:

"Let me set up this project properly..."
→ mcp_init_guided() // Creates structured development plan

"Before I continue, let me check our progress..."  
→ mcp_get_status() // Shows current phase and next tasks

"Am I drifting from the plan?"
→ mcp_check_drift() // Keeps conversation on track

"This needs technical review..."
→ mcp_technical_review() // GPT-4 analyzes, returns summary

"Let me pick up this old project..."
→ mcp_analyze_project() // Generates recovery plan
```

### Real Claude Conversation:
```
User: "I want to build a task management SaaS"

Claude: "I'll use mcp-devkit to set this up properly."
[Calls mcp_init_guided()]

"Perfect! I've created a 3-phase development plan. We're starting 
with Phase 1: Foundation (Next.js + Auth). Let me begin with 
the project setup..."

[2 hours later]

"Let me check our progress before continuing..."
[Calls mcp_get_status()]

"Excellent! We're 65% through Phase 1. Auth system is complete, 
now moving to the user dashboard as planned..."
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install mcp-devkit
```bash
npm install -g mcp-devkit
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-devkit": {
      "command": "mcp-devkit",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start Developing
Open Claude Desktop and start any development project. Claude now has access to persistent project management tools!

```bash
# Try the interactive demo
mcp-devkit demo

# Or initialize a project directly  
mcp-devkit init my-awesome-project
```
