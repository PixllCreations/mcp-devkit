# Claude Workflow Enhancement Architecture

## üéØ Vision: Seamless Claude Development Workflow

### The Problem
- Claude drifts during long development sessions
- Context overload prevents following through on plans  
- No systematic way to maintain development direction
- Difficult to resume abandoned projects
- Multi-agent planning creates context bloat

### The Solution: MCP-Native Development Assistant

mcp-devkit acts as Claude's **persistent development memory and process guide**, allowing Claude to:
1. **Stay on track** with structured development plans
2. **Delegate heavy lifting** to specialized AI agents without context loss
3. **Resume any project** by analyzing existing state
4. **Maintain focus** on current tasks while keeping the big picture

## üîÑ Claude Workflow Enhancement Patterns

### Pattern 1: Project Initialization
```
Claude: "I'll set up this project properly using mcp-devkit"
‚Üí Calls mcp_analyze_project("new") 
‚Üí Gets project structure recommendations
‚Üí Calls mcp_init_guided() with requirements
‚Üí Multi-agent planning happens in background
‚Üí Claude gets summary: "Project initialized with 3-phase plan"
‚Üí Calls mcp_next_task() to start development
```

### Pattern 2: Staying On Track During Development
```
Claude: "Before I implement this feature..."
‚Üí Calls mcp_get_status() 
‚Üí "Currently in Phase 2: API Implementation"
‚Üí "Next task: User authentication system"
‚Üí Calls mcp_check_drift(currentDiscussion)
‚Üí "Proposed work aligns with current phase"
‚Üí Proceeds with confidence
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Agent Consultation Without Context Loss
```
Claude: "This architectural decision needs review"
‚Üí Calls mcp_technical_review(component="auth-system", type="architecture")
‚Üí GPT-4 analyzes in background, returns summary
‚Üí Claude gets: "GPT-4 recommends JWT with refresh tokens, flagged security considerations"
‚Üí Can make informed decision without losing context
```

### Pattern 4: Project Recovery
```
Claude: "This project seems stalled, let me analyze it"
‚Üí Calls mcp_analyze_project("stalled")
‚Üí Gets: "Project 60% complete, last activity 2 weeks ago, next: database integration"
‚Üí Calls mcp_plan_refinement(focus="implementation") 
‚Üí Gets updated plan for completion
‚Üí Calls mcp_next_task() to resume development
```

## üìä MCP Resources for Persistent Context

### Project State Resources
```typescript
{
  "project://current-status": {
    description: "Real-time project status and metrics",
    mimeType: "application/json",
    content: {
      phase: "implementation",
      progress: "67%",
      currentFocus: "user-authentication",
      blockers: [],
      nextSteps: ["Implement JWT handler", "Add password validation"],
      estimatedCompletion: "3 days"
    }
  },
  
  "project://architecture-decisions": {
    description: "Key architectural decisions made",
    mimeType: "text/markdown",
    content: "# Architecture Decisions\n\n## ADR-001: Authentication Strategy..."
  },
  
  "project://task-history": {
    description: "Completed tasks and lessons learned", 
    mimeType: "application/json",
    content: {
      completed: [...],
      inProgress: [...],
      blocked: [...],
      lessonsLearned: [...]
    }
  }
}
```

## üß† Claude Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Starting a New Project
```
User: "I want to build a task management API"

Claude: "I'll use mcp-devkit to set this up properly. Let me initialize a structured development process."

[Calls mcp_init_guided(projectType="api", requirements="task management with auth")]

"Perfect! I've set up a 3-phase development plan:
- Phase 1: Core API structure (3 days)  
- Phase 2: Authentication & authorization (2 days)
- Phase 3: Task CRUD operations (4 days)

The multi-agent team has refined the architecture. Let me start with the first task."

[Calls mcp_next_task()]

"Starting with: Set up Express.js project structure with TypeScript..."
```

### Example 2: Mid-Development Check-in
```
Claude: "Before I continue with the user model, let me check our progress..."

[Calls mcp_get_status()]

"Good! We're on track with Phase 1. Database setup is complete, API structure is in place. 
Next priority is user authentication as planned.

Let me also check if this implementation approach needs review..."

[Calls mcp_technical_review(component="user-model", type="architecture")]

"GPT-4 suggests using bcrypt for password hashing and adding email validation. I'll incorporate these recommendations."
```

### Example 3: Project Recovery
```
User: "I started this project months ago but got stuck"

Claude: "Let me analyze the existing project state and create a recovery plan."

[Calls mcp_analyze_project("stalled")]

"I can see this is a React app that's about 40% complete. The component structure is good, but you got stuck on state management. 

Let me run a planning refinement to update the approach..."

[Calls mcp_plan_refinement(focus="implementation")]

"The multi-agent team suggests switching to Zustand for simpler state management. Here's your updated development plan to finish this project..."
```
