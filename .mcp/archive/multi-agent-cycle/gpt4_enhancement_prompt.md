- **Systematic planning documents** (PRD, Architecture, TaskList)
- **Integration guides** for Claude Code, RepoPrompt, and Serena
- **Best practices** for effective AI-assisted development

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 1000+ developers using mcp-devkit within 6 months
- **Template Usage**: Average 5+ templates used per project
