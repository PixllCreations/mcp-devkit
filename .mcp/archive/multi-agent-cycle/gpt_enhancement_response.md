“title”: “Integration Protocols”,
“location”: “after Template Specification & Validation”,
“content”: “### Integration Protocols\n- Claude Code: Uses the Integration SDK to wrap prompts and manage session IDs; communication occurs via local HTTP proxy on port 7781.\n- RepoPrompt: .mcp/repo-context.json is updated post-commit via Git hook.\n- Serena: Templates expose a serena.yml playbook consumed by Serena to orchestrate agent prompts.\n- Compatibility: Protocols follow Semantic Versioning; breaking changes require a major version bump.”,
