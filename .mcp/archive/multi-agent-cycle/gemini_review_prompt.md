| High | High | **Critical** | Must address before proceeding |
| High | Medium | **High** | Address in current phase |
| High | Low | **Medium** | Monitor and plan mitigation |
| Medium | High | **Medium** | Address in current phase |
| Medium | Medium | **Low** | Document and monitor |
| Low | Any | **Low** | Document only |

### Review Focus Areas for This PRD

#### Business Viability
- Is the methodology market demand realistic?
- Are adoption targets achievable?
- Will developers actually use this approach?
- What are the competitive threats?

#### Technical Feasibility
- Are the template validation requirements realistic?
- Can the multi-agent workflow scale effectively?
- Are integration requirements technically sound?
- What happens when AI models change or become unavailable?

#### User Adoption Risks
- Will developers find the methodology too complex?
- Are onboarding requirements reasonable?
- What barriers exist to widespread adoption?
- How do we handle resistance to change?

#### Operational Challenges
- Can the methodology be maintained long-term?
- How do we handle community contributions at scale?
- What happens if key tools (Claude Code) change or disappear?
- Are resource requirements sustainable?

## Critical Analysis Process

### 1. Risk Identification
Systematically identify risks in categories:
- **Methodology Risks**: Template complexity, workflow overhead, adoption barriers
- **Technical Risks**: Tool integration failures, AI model changes, scalability issues
- **Business Risks**: Market competition, user adoption, value proposition
- **Operational Risks**: Maintenance burden, community management, documentation drift
- **Strategic Risks**: Ecosystem dependencies, technology shifts, competitive responses

### 2. Edge Case Analysis
Consider scenarios that could break the methodology:
- Very small projects (< 1 week development)
- Very large projects (> 100 developers)
- Non-English speaking developers
- Developers without AI tool access
- Legacy technology environments
- Highly regulated industries

### 3. Failure Mode Analysis
For each component, ask:
- What happens if templates are too complex?
- How would we detect methodology adoption failure?
- How would we recover from poor user experience?
- What's the impact if multi-agent workflow fails?
- Are there cascading failure risks?

### 4. Scalability Stress Testing
Consider growth scenarios:
- 10x user growth in 6 months
- 100+ community-contributed templates
- Integration with enterprise development workflows
- Adaptation to new AI models and tools
- International adoption and localization needs

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST

**DOCUMENT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- [ ] **DO NOT change the document layout** - you are reviewing, not rewriting
- [ ] **USE CANVAS or generate a downloadable .md file** for any document updates
- [ ] **PRESERVE ALL FORMATTING** including checkboxes [ ], emoji headers, and markdown structure
- [ ] **PROVIDE FEEDBACK SEPARATELY** - don't edit the PRD directly unless critical errors found
- [ ] **THINK CRITICALLY** before suggesting changes. Focus on risks and improvements
- [ ] **ASK QUESTIONS** if anything about the methodology or requirements is unclear

**REVIEW APPROACH:**
- Provide critical analysis in the format specified below
- Only suggest document changes for critical issues
- Focus on risk identification rather than document restructuring
- Maintain the multi-agent refinement tracking sections

## Your Task

1. **Critically Review** the enhanced PRD from multiple risk perspectives
2. **Identify** potential failure modes and adoption barriers
3. **Challenge** key assumptions about user behavior and market demand
4. **Assess** competitive threats and mitigation strategies
5. **Validate** success metrics and timeline feasibility
6. **Recommend** specific risk mitigation approaches

## Output Format

### Risk Assessment Summary
```markdown
## Gemini Critical Review (Round 3)

### Executive Risk Summary
**Overall Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
**Primary Concerns**: [Top 3 risks identified]
**Blocking Issues**: [Issues that must be resolved before proceeding]

### Critical Risks Identified
1. **[Risk Name]** - [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
   - **Description**: [What could go wrong]
   - **Impact**: [Business/technical impact]
   - **Probability**: [High/Medium/Low]
   - **Mitigation**: [Recommended mitigation strategy]

### Edge Cases Identified
- [Edge case 1 and handling strategy]
- [Edge case 2 and handling strategy]

### Scalability Concerns
- [Scalability issue 1 and solution]

- [Recommendation 2]
- [Recommendation 3]
```

### Final Assessment
[Provide overall assessment: APPROVE / APPROVE WITH CHANGES / MAJOR REVISION NEEDED]

## Decision Framework

### When to Recommend APPROVE
- Risks are identified and adequately mitigated
- Business case is sound and realistic
- Adoption barriers are manageable
- Success metrics are achievable
- Competitive position is strong

### When to Recommend APPROVE WITH CHANGES
- Medium-high risks need specific mitigation
- Some success metrics need adjustment
- Minor adoption barriers need addressing
- Timeline or resource allocation needs refinement

### When to Recommend MAJOR REVISION NEEDED
- Critical or high-probability risks identified
- Fundamental flaws in methodology approach
- Unrealistic assumptions about market or users
- Significant competitive threats not addressed
- Success criteria are not achievable

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Methodology Red Flags
- Templates too complex for average developers
- Multi-agent workflow too time-consuming
- Unclear value proposition for users
- Over-reliance on specific AI tools
- No clear path to adoption

### Business Red Flags
- Unrealistic user adoption projections
- No clear competitive differentiation
- Assumptions about developer behavior not validated
- No sustainable community model
- Unclear monetization or sustainability path

### Technical Red Flags
- Dependencies on rapidly changing AI ecosystem
- No validation of template effectiveness
- Integration requirements too complex
- Scalability not properly considered
- No fallback plans for tool unavailability

## Quality Standards

Your review should:
- [ ] Identify specific, actionable risks
- [ ] Provide concrete mitigation strategies
- [ ] Consider both short-term and long-term perspectives
- [ ] Challenge assumptions constructively
- [ ] Focus on highest-impact issues first
- [ ] Provide clear recommendations for improvement
- [ ] Consider diverse user scenarios and edge cases

Remember: Your role is to be the voice of skepticism and risk awareness. Challenge everything constructively, identify what could go wrong, and ensure the team considers all angles before proceeding. A thorough review now prevents costly problems later.
