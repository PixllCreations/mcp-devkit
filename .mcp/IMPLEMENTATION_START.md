## 🎯 First Steps (Today!)

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Go to GitHub and create 'mcp-devkit' repo
# Clone it locally
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-devkit.git
cd mcp-devkit
```

### 2. Copy Planning Docs
```bash
# Copy this entire .mcp directory to your new repo
cp -r /Users/escott/Documents/Personal/pid/.mcp ./docs/planning/
```

### 3. Start Phase 0, Task 001
Open `./docs/planning/phase-0-tasks.md` and begin with TASK-001!

## 💡 Key Insights from Planning

### From Multi-Agent Review:
1. **Gemini was right** - Don't hardcode 3 agents, make it pluggable
2. **MCP Server is the key** - This solves Claude's drift and memory problems
3. **Focus on Claude workflow** - This is Claude's persistent development partner

### Architecture Decisions Made:
- **Primary Interface**: MCP server for Claude integration
- **Secondary Interface**: CLI tool for direct usage
- TypeScript with strict mode
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for MCP server
- Project state persistence across sessions
- Multi-agent orchestration without context loss
- Development guidance and anti-drift features

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Week 1: Working `mcp init` + claude-code-requirements-builder analysis
- Week 2: Working validator system
- Week 3: Working agent enhancement + basic integrations  
- Week 3.5: Full tool integrations (RepoPrompt, Serena, forked components)
- Week 4: Published to npm with comprehensive docs

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The planning phase is complete. You have:
- Clear requirements
- Detailed task breakdowns  
- Agile sprint structure
- Architecture decisions

Time to start coding! Open `phase-0-tasks.md` and let's build this thing! 🚀
