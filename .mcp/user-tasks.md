# User Tasks for mcp-devkit Implementation

> **Status**: Ready for Implementation  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-06-29  
> **Phase**: Transition from Planning to Development

## üéØ Critical User Tasks Before Development Begins

### ‚úÖ Completed Planning Phase
- [x] PRD created and refined through multi-agent process
- [x] Architecture documented with MCP server approach
- [x] Task breakdown into agile sprints (26 story points for Sprint 1)
- [x] Integration strategy defined for tool ecosystem
- [x] All documents updated to reflect enhanced vision

### üöß Required User Actions (Blocking Development)

#### **TASK-USER-001: Create GitHub Repository** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Status**: üî¥ **REQUIRED BEFORE DEVELOPMENT**  
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes  
**Priority**: BLOCKING

**Action Items:**
1. Go to GitHub and create new repository named `mcp-devkit`
2. Set repository to **Public** (for portfolio visibility)
3. Initialize with:
   - ‚úÖ MIT License
   - ‚úÖ .gitignore (Node.js template)
   - ‚úÖ Initial README.md
4. Clone repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[yourusername]/mcp-devkit.git
   cd mcp-devkit
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Repository exists at github.com/[yourusername]/mcp-devkit
- [x] Repository is cloned locally
- [x] Can commit and push to main branch

#### **TASK-USER-002: Copy Planning Documentation** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Status**: üî¥ **REQUIRED BEFORE DEVELOPMENT**  
**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes  
**Priority**: BLOCKING

**Action Items:**
1. Copy entire `.mcp/` directory to new repository:
   ```bash
   # From inside your new mcp-devkit repository
   cp -r /Users/escott/Documents/Personal/pid/.mcp ./docs/planning/
   ```

2. Commit planning documents:
   ```bash
   git add docs/planning/
   git commit -m "Add comprehensive planning documentation

   üìã Includes:
   - Product Requirements Document (PRD) with multi-agent refinement
   - Technical architecture for MCP server approach
   - Sprint-based task breakdown (4 phases, 26 story points)
   - Integration strategy for tool ecosystem
   - Claude workflow examples and usage scenarios

   üéØ Generated with mcp-devkit methodology (eating our own dog food!)

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   
   git push origin main
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] All planning docs visible in GitHub repository
- [x] Planning documentation is preserved for reference
- [x] Ready to begin Sprint 1 implementation

#### **TASK-USER-003: Review Sprint 1 Tasks** ‚ÑπÔ∏è **RECOMMENDED**
**Status**: üü° **RECOMMENDED**  
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes  
**Priority**: HIGH

**Action Items:**
1. Review `docs/planning/phase-0-tasks.md` for Sprint 1 breakdown
2. Understand the 5-day development plan (26 story points)
3. Confirm comfort level with TypeScript, Commander.js, and MCP protocol
4. Identify any tools/dependencies that need installation

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Familiar with Sprint 1 scope and timeline
- [x] Development environment ready for TypeScript/Node.js
- [x] Ready to begin TASK-001 (Project Setup)

## ü§ñ Claude's Implementation Readiness

Once the above user tasks are complete, Claude is ready to begin implementation with:

- ‚úÖ **Complete Project Vision**: MCP server as Claude's persistent development partner
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Architecture**: TypeScript, Commander.js CLI, MCP protocol integration
- ‚úÖ **Sprint Planning**: 26 story points broken into specific daily tasks
- ‚úÖ **Success Metrics**: Clear definition of done for each phase
- ‚úÖ **Integration Strategy**: RepoPrompt, Serena, claude-code-requirements-builder
- ‚úÖ **Risk Mitigation**: Identified and planned for critical risks

## üìã Development Workflow Once Started

When Claude begins implementation, the workflow will be:

1. **Daily Standups**: Review todo list and current sprint progress
2. **Task Execution**: Implement tasks from phase-0-tasks.md sequentially
3. **Progress Tracking**: Update completion status in real-time
4. **Quality Gates**: Run tests, linting, and validation before marking complete
5. **Sprint Reviews**: Assess progress and plan next sprint

## üéØ Success Indicators

**Week 1 Target** (Sprint 1 Complete):
- ‚úÖ Working `mcp init` command
- ‚úÖ Template system creates `.mcp/` project structure
- ‚úÖ Basic CLI with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline operational

**Portfolio Value**:
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates systematic project planning
- ‚úÖ Shows multi-agent AI workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ Proves ability to build developer tools
- ‚úÖ Exhibits modern TypeScript/Node.js practices
- ‚úÖ Shows integration with AI ecosystem (MCP protocol)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### For User:
- **Don't start coding yet** - Complete the GitHub repository setup first
- **Preserve planning docs** - They demonstrate the methodology in action
- **Commit with good messages** - This is a portfolio project

### For Claude:
- **Always check user tasks first** - Verify GitHub repo exists before development
- **Reference planning docs** - Use `.mcp/phase-0-tasks.md` for implementation guidance
- **Track progress systematically** - Update todo list as tasks complete
- **Maintain quality standards** - This represents your development capabilities
