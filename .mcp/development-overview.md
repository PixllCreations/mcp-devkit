# MCP DevKit Development Overview

> **Project Type**: Personal/Portfolio Project  
> **Timeline**: 4 weeks (4 sprints)  
> **Methodology**: Agile with 1-week sprints

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a working implementation of mcp-devkit that demonstrates:
- Clean architecture and TypeScript expertise
- CLI development skills
- AI/LLM integration capabilities
- Strong documentation and presentation
- Real-world utility (I'll actually use this!)

## 📅 Development Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Get a working CLI with `mcp init` command
- Set up project infrastructure
- Build core CLI framework
- Implement template initialization
- **Deliverable**: Working `mcp init` that creates projects

### Phase 1: Core Features (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal**: Add validation and AI agent integration
- Build template validation system
- Create pluggable agent architecture
- Implement enhancement commands
- **Deliverable**: Full feature set with `validate`, `enhance`, and `cycle`

### Phase 1.5: Tool Integrations (Week 3.5)
**Goal**: Integrate with existing ecosystem tools
- Fork and integrate claude-code-requirements-builder components
- Implement RepoPrompt auto-generation
- Add Serena workflow orchestration
- **Deliverable**: Seamless integration with existing AI dev tools

### Phase 2: Polish & Portfolio (Week 4)
**Goal**: Make it portfolio-ready
- Create impressive demos
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Publish npm package
- **Deliverable**: Published package with full docs

## 🏃‍♂️ Sprint Schedule

### Sprint Planning
- **When**: Start of each week (Monday)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Output**: Selected tasks for the week

### Daily Standups (Self)
- **When**: Start of each coding session
- **Questions**:
  - What did I complete last session?
  - What will I work on today?
  - Any blockers?

### Sprint Review/Retro
- **When**: End of each week (Friday)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Output**: Demo + lessons learned

## 📊 Velocity Tracking

| Sprint | Planned SP | Completed SP | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | 28 | - | Foundation + Fork Analysis |
| Sprint 2 | 26 | - | Validation System |
| Sprint 3 | 31 | - | Agents + Basic Integrations |
| Sprint 3.5 | 18 | - | Tool Integrations (claude-code-req-builder, RepoPrompt, Serena) |
| Sprint 4 | 23 | - | Polish & Portfolio |

## 🎨 Architecture Principles

### 1. Pluggable Everything
- Agents are pluggable (not hardcoded to 3 specific ones)
- Validators are pluggable (can add custom rules)
- Templates are pluggable (can add new types)

### 2. Excellent Developer Experience
- Beautiful CLI output with colors and animations
- Helpful error messages
- Progress indication for long operations
- Sensible defaults

### 3. Test-Driven Development
- Write tests first for core functionality
- Maintain >80% coverage
- Integration tests for CLI commands

### 4. Documentation-First
- Document as you build
- Include examples for everything
- Keep README updated

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### Core
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **Package Manager**: npm

### CLI
- **Framework**: Commander.js
- **Output**: Chalk (colors), Ora (spinners)
- **Prompts**: Inquirer.js

### MCP Server
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Server Framework**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **Transport**: stdio, SSE, or WebSocket
- **Tools**: Template management, validation, agent orchestration

### Validation
- **Schema**: AJV with JSON Schema
- **Markdown**: Remark/Unified
- **File System**: Native fs + glob

### Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest
- **Coverage**: @vitest/coverage-v8
- **Mocking**: Native Vitest mocks

### Build & Deploy
- **Bundler**: esbuild
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Docs**: TypeDoc + GitHub Pages
- **Package**: npm

## 🚀 Definition of Done

A feature is DONE when:
1. ✅ Code is written and works
2. ✅ Tests are written and pass
3. ✅ Documentation is updated
4. ✅ TypeScript has no errors
5. ✅ Demo/example is created
6. ✅ Committed to main branch

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] All commands work as designed
- [ ] Performance meets targets (<5s validation)
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] >80% test coverage

### Portfolio
- [ ] Impressive demo video/GIF
- [ ] Professional documentation
- [ ] Published npm package
- [ ] Clean GitHub repository

### Personal Use
- [ ] Actually useful for my projects
- [ ] Saves time vs. manual approach
- [ ] Easy to extend and customize

## 🎯 Stretch Goals

If ahead of schedule:
1. VS Code extension (basic)
2. Web UI for template editing
3. GitHub Action for validation
4. More AI provider integrations
5. Template marketplace prototype

## 📝 Notes

- Since this is for personal use, I can skip user research
- Focus on making it actually useful for myself first
- Polish and portfolio features come after core functionality
- Keep scope manageable - can always add features later
