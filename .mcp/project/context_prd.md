## 📋 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Claude and other AI assistants suffer from critical limitations during software development:

- **Context Drift**: Long development sessions lead Claude to lose focus and drift from the original plan
- **Memory Loss**: Project context is lost between sessions, requiring constant re-explanation
- **No Persistence**: Architectural decisions and progress disappear when conversations end
- **Context Overload**: Multi-agent planning creates bloated conversations that break Claude's effectiveness
- **Project Abandonment**: No way to recover or resume stalled projects systematically

These limitations prevent developers from leveraging Claude's full potential for complex, multi-session development projects.

### Solution Overview
mcp-devkit is Claude's **persistent development partner** - an MCP server that provides:

- **Persistent Project Memory**: Project state, decisions, and progress survive across all Claude sessions
- **Development Guidance**: Systematic task prioritization and drift prevention to keep Claude focused
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Delegate planning and review to specialized AIs without context loss
- **Project Recovery**: Analyze and resume any abandoned or stalled project with specific recovery plans
- **Structured Development Process**: Proven methodology with clear phases, tasks, and success criteria
- **Seamless Claude Integration**: Native MCP tools that Claude can call directly during development

## 🎨 User Experience Requirements

### Key User Flows
1. **Project Setup Flow**: Copy templates → Fill templates → Initialize multi-agent process
2. **Refinement Flow**: Claude draft → GPT-4 enhancement → Gemini review → Iteration
3. **Context Management Flow**: Update context files → Validate completeness → Version control
4. **Validation Feedback Flow**: CLI / VS Code extension surfaces errors in real-time

### Methodology Principles
- **Simplicity**: Templates should be intuitive and easy to complete
- **Consistency**: Standard format across all templates and processes
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different project types and team sizes
- **Transparency**: Clear tracking of decisions and refinements
- **Immediate Feedback**: VS Code extension surfaces validation errors inline

## 🔧 Template Specification & Validation

- **Format**: Markdown files with optional YAML front-matter for metadata
- **Schema Definition**: Each template accompanied by a JSON Schema file kept in .mcp/schemas
- **Validation Pipeline**: AJV-based CLI (`mcp validate`) and GitHub Action using @actions/core
- **Reporting**: Generates validation_report.md summarizing failures with line numbers and rule IDs
- **Extensibility**: Custom rules can be added via npm packages exporting an ICustomRule interface

## ⚙️ Integration Protocols

- **Claude Code**: Uses the Integration SDK to wrap prompts and manage session IDs; communication occurs via local HTTP proxy on port 7781
- **RepoPrompt**: .mcp/repo-context.json is updated post-commit via Git hook
- **Serena**: Templates expose a serena.yml playbook consumed by Serena to orchestrate agent prompts
- **Compatibility**: Protocols follow Semantic Versioning; breaking changes require a major version bump

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- **Validation runtime**: ≤5s on 2k-file monorepo (M1 Pro, 16GB RAM)
- **Performance Benchmark**: Validator must complete full repository scan of 10k files ≤15s on a 4-core laptop
- **CLI memory footprint**: ≤200MB peak
- **VS Code extension lint debounce**: ≤300ms
- Multi-agent refinement: Complete cycle in under 60 minutes
- Documentation load time: Context files readable in any text editor

### Security Requirements
- No sensitive data stored in templates (user responsibility)
- Git-friendly file formats (plain markdown)
- Validator CLI performs only local file IO; no network calls required

### Scalability Requirements
- Support repositories up to 50k files & 5GB without >2× performance degradation
- Template library can grow with community contributions; marketplace index paginated & cached
- Methodology scales across different AI models and tools

### Validation & Testing Infrastructure
- **CI**: GitHub Action matrix on Node 18/20, Linux+macOS
- **Sample Repos**: examples/ folder with 3 canonical projects run in nightly regression
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest ≥90% coverage on validator logic

### Resource Requirements
- **Development Effort**: 2 FT engineers × 4 weeks for core CLI + templates
- **CI Minutes**: ~1000 mins/month (open-source tier)
- **Community Management**: 1 maintainer triaging PRs, reviews ≤48h

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Refinement Notes

### Claude's Draft (Round 1)
**Focus Areas**: Defined comprehensive methodology scope, user needs analysis, and systematic approach to AI-assisted development. Emphasized template-based approach and multi-agent workflows.

**Key Decisions**: 
- Methodology-only approach (not building software)
- Three-agent refinement process (Claude → GPT-4 → Gemini)
- .mcp/ directory structure for persistent context
- Integration with existing Claude Code ecosystem

### GPT-4 Enhancement (Round 2) - JSON Format ✅
**Key Improvements**: Added concrete template validation pipeline and schema registry, specified integration protocols with Claude Code/RepoPrompt/Serena, defined performance benchmarks and additional quality metrics
**Technical Additions**: AJV JSON Schema validation, TypeScript Integration SDK, GitHub Action for CI validation
**Areas for Next Agent**: Assess adoption barriers and propose outreach strategies, benchmark multi-agent orchestration performance under heavy project load

### Gemini Review (Round 3) - JSON Format ✅
**Critical Risks Identified**: High friction vs. perceived value barrier (Critical), ecosystem dependency & brittleness (Critical), unsustainable maintenance burden (High), unrealistic success metrics (High), multi-agent cost and latency (High)
**Key Recommendations**: Conduct 2-4 week user research sprint, architect with pluggable agent interface, build validator CLI PoC for performance validation, revise success metrics to objective measures
**Final Assessment**: APPROVE WITH CHANGES - Potentially viable as niche tool but requires addressing critical adoption, technical design, and sustainability risks
