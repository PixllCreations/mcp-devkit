## üìã Implementation Plan Summary

### Agile Development Approach
We're now following an agile approach with 1-week sprints:

**Phase 0 (Sprint 1)**: Foundation & Setup
- See: `phase-0-tasks.md`
- Goal: Working CLI with init command

**Phase 1 (Sprints 2-3)**: Core Features  
- See: `phase-1-tasks.md`
- Goal: Validation and agent systems

**Phase 1.5 (Sprint 3.5)**: Tool Integrations
- See: `phase-1.5-integrations.md`
- Goal: Integrate claude-code-requirements-builder, RepoPrompt, Serena

**Phase 2 (Sprint 4)**: Polish & Portfolio
- See: `phase-2-tasks.md`
- Goal: Portfolio-ready with documentation

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Pluggable agents** instead of hardcoded 3-agent flow (addresses Gemini's critical feedback)
2. **Personal/portfolio focus** - no need for extensive user research
3. **Minimal MVP** - start with basic features, polish later
4. **Test-driven development** - maintain high quality for portfolio

### Next Immediate Actions
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Set up TypeScript project
3. Implement basic CLI structure
4. Start with TASK-001 from phase-0-tasks.md

*This task list has been updated to reflect an agile development approach suitable for a personal/portfolio project.*
